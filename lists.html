        <dt><h4>Simple<h4></dt>
        <dd>Java is very easy to learn, and its syntax is simple, clean and easy to understand. According to Sun Microsystem, Java language is a simple programming language because:</dd>
        <ul>
            <li>Java syntax is based on C++ (so easier for programmers to learn it after C++).</li>
            <li>Java has removed many complicated and rarely-used features, for example, explicit pointers, operator overloading, etc.</li>
            <li>There is no need to remove unreferenced objects because there is an Automatic Garbage Collection in Java.</li>
        </ul>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><h4>Object-oriented<h4></dt>
        <dd>Java is an object-oriented programming language. Everything in Java is an object. Object-oriented means we organize our software as a combination of different types of objects that incorporate both data and behavior.
            Object-oriented programming (OOPs) is a methodology that simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some rules.
        </dd>
        <br>
        <dd>Basic concepts of OOPs are:</dd>
        <ol>
            <li>Object</li>
            <li>Class</li>
            <li>Inheritence</li>
            <li>Polymorphism</li>
            <li>Abstraction</li>
            <li>Encapsulation</li>
            
        </ol>

        <dt><h4>Platform Independent<h4></dt>
        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/images/core/platform-independent-java.png" />
        <dd>Java is platform independent because it is different from other languages like C, C++, etc. which are compiled into platform specific machines while Java is a write once, run anywhere language. A platform is the hardware or software environment in which a program runs.</dd>
        <br>
        <dd>There are two types of platforms software-based and hardware-based. Java provides a software-based platform.</dd>
        <br>
        <dd>The Java platform differs from most other platforms in the sense that it is a software-based platform that runs on top of other hardware-based platforms. It has two components:</dd>
        <ol>
            <li>Runtime Environment</li>
            <li>API(Application Programming Interface).</li>
        </ol>
        <dd>Java code can be executed on multiple platforms, for example, Windows, Linux, Sun Solaris, Mac/OS, etc. Java code is compiled by the compiler and converted into bytecode. This bytecode is a platform-independent code because it can be run on multiple platforms, i.e., Write Once and Run Anywhere (WORA).</dd>
